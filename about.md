Hey! I'm Lei M. Zhang, a recent PhD graduate from the Department of ECE at the University of Toronto. My research focused on the fields of information theory and coding theory and was supervised by professor [Frank Kschischang](http://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~frank/index.html). I was able to provide a theory behind one of the most efficient error-correcting codes used in modern fiber-optic communication systems, called [Staircase Codes](http://hdl.handle.net/1807/79549). 

A list of all my publications and citations can be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=-kdBDxYAAAAJ&hl=en).

Currently, I'm interested in the intersection of deep neural networks, variational inference, and information theory. I'm excited by the fact that information theory appears to be a driving force behind improving performance ([InfoGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03657)), reducing errors ([Entropy regularizer for adversarial robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02846)), or even as a possible theorey for the unreasonable effectiveness of deep neural networks ([Information bottleneck](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-theory-cracks-open-the-black-box-of-deep-learning-20170921)).
